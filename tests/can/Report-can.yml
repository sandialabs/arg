  title: Introduction
  latex: 'This sample report illustrates the automatic report generator (ARG).
    \par We simply recall that the \emph{equivalent plastic strain rate}
    is defined as follows: \[\dot{\bar{\epsilon}}=\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}\dot{\epsilon_{ij}}^{p}\dot{\epsilon_{ij}}^{p},}\]
    where $\dot{\epsilon_{ij}}^{p}$ is the \emph{plastic strain rate}.'
