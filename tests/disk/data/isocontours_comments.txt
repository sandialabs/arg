Note that, unlike surface renderings, isocontouring only makes sense for point-centered, scalar attributes. If the variable is cell-centered instead, it must be interpolated before iso-contours can be computed. As a result, interpolation errors will occur.

We chose two isocontour values that are close enough from the minimum and maximum values for that attribute, because we want to highlight:
- the heated disk;
- the cooler air mass surrounding it.

In a more refined implementation of this generator, we could specificy a range of values so several contours can be shown in the same image.
