This page aims to provide functional overview, including interactions between eahc of the 3 application composing ARG, and their expected inputs and outputs.  

## Functional Overview

### Explorator

The **Explorator** delves into provided input directory to create a report structure and artifacts. 
It takes data directory and parameters to detect where to scan piece of information to report. It generates a so-called structure file in a YML format, and specifies the exact content and structure of the report to be generated. 

### Generator

The **Generator** creates artifacts and respective captions based on provided structure input file and data directory.  
Data directory and artifacts file and expected as inputs for that component to know where to fetch data before creating artifacts as detailed in the artifacts file. 

### Assembler

The **Assembler** generates the report based on provided structure and figures.  
It requires a structure file to specify the structure and content to follow, and possible artifacts generated by the **Generator**. When artifacts are missing, the *Assembler** can also call methods from the **Generator** to create them on-the-run.  It then produces reports under a `.docx` format, or `.tex` and/or `.pdf`.  
Indeed, a new feature has recently been introduced to stop the generation of a LaTeX report to a `.tex` file. 


**Remark** on `Explorator-Assembler` interplay: The role of the **Explorator** is to generate the parameters file when it is not provided, but must instead be determined after exploration of the provided data.
