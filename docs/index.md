# ARG
Welcome to the documentation site of the Automatic Report Generator (ARG)!

## Background
The Automatic Report Generator (ARG) is the result of the vision set forth by Robert Clay (Sandia National Laboratories), who observed that, in particular in the context of large-scale, complex-physics Modeling & Simulation (ModSim):
* reporting is a key element of a ModSim analysis workflow;
* reporting is extremely time consuming;
* ModSim workflows involve automation and therefore reporting should be automated.

As a result, the ARG project began with Philippe Pébaÿ (NexGen Analytics) as it original designer and developer in April 2017, in order to:
* increase reporting reproducibility;
* reduce errors and analyst-to-analyst variance;
* help analysts focus on critical domain questions, rather than repeating tedious report creation tasks.

## License
ARG was released as open-source software (OSS) under a [BSD 3-clause license]({% link license.md %}).
